# CMS Showdown: Project Management

Ever had the chance to choose a frontend and backend for your new greenfield project and thought, "What the heck do I do now?"
Well, you're in luck, as this project compares two ways of handling the "modern CMS tech stack" challenge using established contenders
that can do it all and newcomers that are growing in popularity. 

This project compares two CMS stacks:

## CMS Hulk
- **Frontend:** [Next.js Repo](https://github.com/org/cms-hulk-next)
- **Backend:** [Drupal Repo](https://github.com/org/cms-hulk-drupal)

## Ultimate CMS Warrior
- **Frontend:** [Astro Repo](https://github.com/org/ultimate-cms-warrior-astro)
- **Backend:** [GelData Repo](https://github.com/org/ultimate-cms-warrior-geldata)

## Project Management

See the [Project Board](https://github.com/users/alexfinnarn/projects/2/views/1?template_dialog_tab=featured&layout_template=table) 
for status on the showdown and evaluation criteria.
